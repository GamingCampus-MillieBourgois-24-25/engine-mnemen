/// @brief A class representing a ray-tracing acceleration structure resource.
///
/// The `AccelerationStructure` class is a resource used in ray-tracing pipelines to speed up the
/// process of intersecting rays with geometry. It encapsulates the creation, management, and 
/// scratch memory associated with the acceleration structure, providing an efficient way to
/// handle ray tracing operations in a graphics API like DirectX 12.

    /// creation and descriptor heaps for managing shader resources.
