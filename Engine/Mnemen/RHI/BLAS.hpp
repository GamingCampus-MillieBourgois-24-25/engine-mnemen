/// A Bottom-Level Acceleration Structure (BLAS) represents the geometric data in a ray-tracing
/// pipeline. It contains all the geometry information required to perform ray intersection tests 
/// and is typically constructed from vertex and index buffers. BLASes are used to build top-level 
/// acceleration structures (TLAS), which contain instances of BLASes for ray tracing in a scene.
