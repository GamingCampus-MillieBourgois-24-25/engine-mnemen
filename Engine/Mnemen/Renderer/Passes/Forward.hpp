/// the scene. In forward rendering, each object in the scene is rendered with its full lighting 
/// computation in a single pass, which can be simpler but less efficient for scenes with many lights. 
/// This class extends the `RenderPass` class.

    /// scene using the forward rendering technique. The RHI is passed to the base class `RenderPass`
    /// for managing hardware-specific rendering operations.
